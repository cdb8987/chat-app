1. update server side /login route to append generated token to a generated_token_log list.  

2. create a server side function which takes the generated_token_log parameter and returns a list of actively logged in usernames
    -checks if a token has not expired
    -Filter the generated token list to only tokens that are active and are not contained in the token blacklist.
4.  For active, valid tokens, extract and return a list of their associated usernames. 
5.  Create a list called active_users and update it with the results of the function.  Trigger this function once per minute on an increment (to get rid of expired tokens).  Also trigger this function from the front end when a user clicks "logout" so that logged out users no longer show up
5.  Create a front end function that updates the state of users with a call to the server at /retrieve users route every 5 seconds.
